# Financial Mathematics in C++

This Project is a based on my implementations in Python found [here](https://github.com/ThoranTschoepe/FinancialMathmaticsNotebooks) but in some cases some methods are further developed.

## Disclaimer

The Project is still in development and not all methods are implemented yet. The implemented methods are not guaranteed to be bug free. The Project is not intended to be used in production. It is just a project to learn more about financial mathematics and C++.
